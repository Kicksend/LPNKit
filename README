LPNKit is (read: will be) an Objective-c port of Google's JavaScript library
for parsing, formatting, and validating international phone numbers.

Google's libphonenumber project can be found here:
http://code.google.com/p/libphonenumber/

The goal of LPNKit is to maintain bug-for-bug compatibility with libphonenumber.

There is a c++ version of libphonenumber, but LPNKit aims to stick to
c and Objective-c and to avoid the need for additional dependencies.

This project is very much a work-in-progress, and the api is subject
to significant redesign. At this time, LPNKit should not be considered suitable
for inclusion in any other projects, production or otherwise. ;-)
